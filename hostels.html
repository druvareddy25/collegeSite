            <p style="text-align: justify;">A good institution always strives to transform the students into a knowledgeable and worthy citizen. To accomplish this, good learning environment is very essential. A hostel is truly a home away from home. Students of different types hailing from different regions stay together, representing various traditions, cultures, talents, etc. The hostel gives vast scope for respecting differences of opinions, builds up a healthy union of minds and unites the hearts. The hostel life offers plenty of opportunities for growing, individually and collectively. During the stay in the hostel, the student learns to grow more loveable and capable.

                Besides learning good qualities and habits from others, the student realizes that he/she can also serve as a role model to others. Some of the traits in a cultured person are: remaining simple, humble, honest, open and truthful. Hostel life provides plenty of occasions to grow in all these traits. The hostel environment itself teaches the student to be generous and magnanimous and to excel in such virtues.</p>
