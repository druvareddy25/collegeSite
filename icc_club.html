            An innovation is something original, novel and important that obtains a foothold in a market or society. It
            refers to the notion of inventing something which has not existed in the past and which ultimately leads to
            the advancement, in the society and in the world. Creativity on the other hand is characterized by
            originality, expressiveness and imagination. It is a skill that every human possesses in one's domain or the
            other. This skill in the individuals can be further more nourished through various methods. The skill can be
            creating an idea, a joke, an artistic or literary work, a painting or musical composition, a solution or
