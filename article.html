                <h2>Article 1- Important factors while choosing a college</h2>
                <p>Engineering course is the venue for variety of courses and special employment opportunities. Hence Engineering course is the hot topic for Intermediate and +2 completed students. Students and their parents are easily getting attracted towards the employment and higher education opportunities for engineering graduates in national and international level. Approximately a number of 15 lakh Engineering seats are available in 3500 nationwide Engineering colleges. At-least a number of 700 engineering colleges are available with 3 lakh seats are available alone in Andhrapradesh state, which are 1/5 of total nation wide colleges.

                    While selecting the Engineering college students should consider some important and essential factors for pursuing good and quality based education.<br>
                    Important factors that are needed to be considered while choosing an engineering college:
                    1. Infrastructure
                    2. Faculty
                    3. Year of establishment
                    4. Accrediation
                    5. Placement and training
                    6. Performance
                    7. Co-curriculum - extra extra-curricular activities

                  <h2>Article 2- Quality of education in private technical institutes of India</h2>
                  <p>Self financing institutes in India are the centres satisfying the huge competition of students for engineering seats. India is a developing country and government cannot give education to all students who aspire to become an engineer. So, self financing institutes play a vital role in achieving
                     the goal "higher education for all" which will be the next motto of government. Almost all the students who have 60 to 90% of marks in science stream mostly enter these institutes through government and management quota seats. This means major population of young youth of India get trained here. Now, the quality of these institutes remains the main cause of concern. The cost of education these institutes are high. Hence a mere degree won't serve the purpose. 
                     The value of knowledge that a student have attained after finishing the course remains a determining factor.
                     There are various self financing institutes in India excelling government institutes in imparting knowledge. While some money minded institutes are also there posing a serious threat to student future. 
                     Corruption in getting certification and huge fees collected are also threats in a private institute.<br>
                     1.Infrastructure 
                     2. Faculties
                     3.Student life
                     4.Placement opportunities 
                     All these play an important role in the quality of education.
